# AntiHuBo 🧠🚦  
**Break the Human Bottleneck. Operate AI workflows like a control tower.**

AntiHuBo is an open-source platform that helps humans orchestrate multiple AI tools, agents, and tasks from a single interface — reducing cognitive overload, context-switching fatigue, and decision paralysis. It acts as a "Multi-Tasking AI Control Tower" designed for those who want to survive and grow in the age of Big Tech-dominated AI.

## 🌍 Why AntiHuBo?

While AI models are advancing rapidly, the **bottleneck has shifted to the human side**:

- Too many AI tools, with fragmented interfaces
- Constant switching between tasks, tabs, and tools
- Humans must prompt, review, decide, and re-prompt — over and over again
- AI orchestration is still manual, fragmented, and cognitively taxing

We believe it’s time for a platform that puts humans back in control — but without drowning them in micromanagement.

## 🚀 What Does AntiHuBo Do?

AntiHuBo lets users:

- Control multiple AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Bing, Code models) from a unified dashboard  
- Route tasks to the most appropriate AI engine or tool  
- Store and recall past context and decisions  
- Create workflows and agents that execute tasks automatically  
- Integrate plugins or custom APIs to expand capabilities  

Whether you're writing, coding, researching, summarizing, or automating — AntiHuBo is the platform that lets you multitask through AI.

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP
- Browser extension or desktop app interface  
- Launch and manage multiple AI model instances (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, Mistral)  
- Simple “Task Inbox” for managing assignments  
- Manual routing of tasks to chosen AIs  

### 🔄 Phase 2: Intelligent Orchestration
- Smart Task Routing: AI selects the best tool for the job  
- Memory Layer: track prior context, user preferences, project history  
- Workflow Engine: sequence tasks across multiple agents  
- Plugin Framework: build, share, and reuse task-specific modules  
- Marketplace: allow 3rd party plugins, enterprise integrations  

---

## 🧱 Architecture

Components:

- **Task Inbox**: Queue and prioritize tasks  
- **AI Router**: Direct each task to the most appropriate AI model  
- **Memory Layer**: Store conversation history, user settings, and task context  
- **Plugin Engine**: Extend AntiHuBo via external APIs or AI agents  
- **Frontend UI**: Web-based or app interface for control and review

## 🔭 Vision

We envision a future where:

> "AI does the execution.  
> Humans only set goals and make high-leverage decisions."

AntiHuBo is not just a tool — it’s a response to cognitive exhaustion, a new layer between humans and machines, and a battle cry for open AI autonomy.

Join us in building the infrastructure for multi-tasking AI.
