# AntiHuBo 🧠🚦  
**Break the Human Bottleneck. Operate AI workflows like a control tower.**

AntiHuBo is an open-source platform that helps humans orchestrate multiple AI tools, agents, and tasks from a single interface — reducing cognitive overload, context-switching fatigue, and decision paralysis. It acts as a "Multi-Tasking AI Control Tower" designed for those who want to survive and grow in the age of Big Tech-dominated AI.

## 🌍 Why AntiHuBo?

While AI models are advancing rapidly, the **bottleneck has shifted to the human side**:

- Too many AI tools, with fragmented interfaces
- Constant switching between tasks, tabs, and tools
- Humans must prompt, review, decide, and re-prompt — over and over again
- AI orchestration is still manual, fragmented, and cognitively taxing

We believe it’s time for a platform that puts humans back in control — but without drowning them in micromanagement.

- Simple “Task Inbox” for managing assignments  
- Manual routing of tasks to chosen AIs  

### 🔄 Phase 2: Intelligent Orchestration
- Smart Task Routing: AI selects the best tool for the job  
- Memory Layer: track prior context, user preferences, project history  
- Workflow Engine: sequence tasks across multiple agents  
- Plugin Framework: build, share, and reuse task-specific modules  
- Marketplace: allow 3rd party plugins, enterprise integrations
